# UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge
**Challenge Description**: *The Roche Data Science Coalition (RDSC)* requested the collaborative effort of the AI community to fight COVID-19. This challenge presented a curated collection of datasets from 20 global sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by a global frontline of healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers.

**Selection process**: The challenge works with 3 deadlines: in each one of them, the best solution would be evaluate against other propose solutions.

**Content**: This notebook presents some solutions provided to two studies tasks. For more info go to [Tasks submitted](##tasks-sumitted)

 Summarizing, this repository contains some submissions developed by me for this COVID-19 Challenge.
